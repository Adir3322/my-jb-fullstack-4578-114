        <p>A programming language is a formal set of instructions used to communicate with a computer and create software. It provides a framework that allows developers to write programs to perform specific tasks, from simple operations like calculations to complex systems like operating systems or websites. Each programming language has its own syntax (rules for writing code) and semantics (meaning behind the code), enabling developers to express algorithms and logic in a way that computers can understand and execute. Popular programming languages include Python, JavaScript, and C++, each suited for different types of applications.</p>
